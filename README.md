# 🎧 Digital Signal Processing Based Audio Noise Removal System

This project is a **web-based audio processing tool** designed to remove high-frequency noise from audio signals using a **Biquad Low-Pass Filter** implemented through the Web Audio API.  
Users can upload audio files, visualize the waveform, apply filtering, play both original and processed audio, and download the cleaned output.
